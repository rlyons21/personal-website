		<h3>Update: How things have been Going at Code School</h3>

		<p> For the last couple of weeks our class has been split into groups
		to work on different projects. My group consisted of Mike, Matt and me.
		We were assigned to build a To-Do List app for a specific family that 
		allows tasks to be deleted, added, editted, and filtered by who it is
		assigned to.<br><br>
		This project marked the split between front-end and back-end, but during the
		first week of working on the project I spent time on both front-end and
		back-end. I worked on making the feature of being able to delete a task,
		and also tried to help those in my group with functions if they were 
		struggling. We had a lot of ups and downs throughout the first week.
		The first day we felt we had made a lot of good progress, however,
		the second day we all seemed to hit a wall. With the help of our 
		instructors we managed to build more momentum for the rest of the week.<br><br>
		The second week I focussed mainly on the front-end side our app. We started
		learning JavaScript which allowed me to add some more features to our app.
		We now are able to toggle both completed and unfished lists. I was also 
		able to implement a couple of modals for adding and editting tasks.<br><br>
		When using JavaScript before I did not particularly enjoy it, however,
		now that I'm using the language to improve front-end designs it is really
		starting to grow on me.</p>
