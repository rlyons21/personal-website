	<h3>Query String Parameters</h3>
	URLs can contain query strings which contain data that don't fit into a path structure. For example, when building a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, it would be a hassel to have to build a page for every possible board, instead you can pass the state of the board onto the next page by using a query string. The query string is located in the URL following a "?". The parameters are stored as: "variable=value"<br><br>


	<h3>HTTP</h3>
	HTTP is shorthand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the set of rules for transferring files on the internet. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should in response to various commands. HTTP is considered to be a stateless protocol because commands are executed independently of each other.<br><br>


	<h3>Server</h3>

	<h3>Client</h3>
	 Computers, cell phones, and tablets can all be clients. They access information from servers by sending requests and recieving responses.<br><br> 

	<h3>Response</h3>
	 When a server receives a request, the request information is quickly processed and a response that travels from server to client is sent. The response is the information that is sent back to the client.<br><br> 

	<h3>Pre-Processor</h3>
	 A program that proceses input data by modifying the data to fit the input requirements of another program. </p>
