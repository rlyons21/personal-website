		<h3>The Web</h3>
		<p>I started using the internet in school around 2nd grade. I didn’t know how it worked, I only knew that when my teacher told me to click somewhere that my screen would change in some way, shape or form. By 5th grade I was using it for both school and entertainment. By the time I got into high school I couldn’t imagine life without it, yet I was still oblivious as to how it all worked. </p>

		<p>I grew up with the internet at my fingertips. I use it every single day, whether it be for social media, watching Netflix or looking up random bits of information. If you want to know about anything, you are almost guaranteed to find some, if not a plethora, of information about it on the internet. It is a very good tool for research and learning, however, it is also full of distractions. Whether it is good or bad depends on how you are using it in that given moment. </p>

		<p>But how does the internet work? Internet is short for interconnected network. There are countless computers and devices all over the world that are all interconnected. The computer that is going to send data must first be connected to an internet service prover's (ISP) point of presence (POP), which is an access point that allows you to connect to the internet. All POPs are connected to network access points (NAP). All NAPs are connected to each other via fiber optic cables. Before data can be sent, it is broken into smaller packages that are sent individually with instructions about reassembly for the receiving device. The data is sent via cables (usually copper) to a POP and then onto the internet and travel to different NAPs all over via fiber optic cables. Each device has an I.P. address that tells where the data packets are being sent to. Routers are what guide the packets in the right direction. When all of the packets are received, they are reassembled to make an exact copy of whatever was sent.</p>
