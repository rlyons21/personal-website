	<h3> Tackling Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
	<h4> Day 1 :</h4>
	<p> Before I can begin coding anything, first I have to map out a plan. Building a simple game like tic tac toe sounds easy enough, but knowing only the end result is not enough information to get me there. I began by using a flowchart to write out all of the steps of a game of tic tac toe. I also jotted down a few functions I knew I would need to write, such as a function to check if there is a winner. Next I began to focus on building the grid. I knew I had multiple options for doing this. Using html I could use a 3x3 table or divs. I decided to go with divs.</p>

	<p> As you can see I was a little bit all over the place when trying to plan and map out how to tackle this new beast. Due to this, I hit a wall and did not make much more progress. I was getting ahead of myself, focussing more on the final product than on the steps I needed to take in order to get there. I found it hard to wrap my head around all of the functions I would need to work together and how how they would all fit together. In order to overcome this, I began looking at how classmates who were further along were tackling this project. </p>


	<h4> Day 2 :</h4>
	<p>I spent a lot of time looking at other people’s code. I went through making sure I understood how each piece of code worked and how it affected the project as whole. Once I felt I was ready, I began focussing on all of the functions. One by one I wrote code for functions that would check for a winner, determine what mark to use, print a single square, and print the entire grid.  This may not seem like much, but each function took time to build. Some took much longer than others. But in order for tic tac toe to work properly, I have to know that each piece is working as expected first. So before moving on from a function I would test to see if it was returning what I expected. Many times it wasn’t, so I would rewrite parts of it until it finally passed my tests. At the end of the day, I still did not have a working game of tic tac toe. I did not have all of my needed functions working properly either. But I did make a lot of progress, knew where I was going and had a plan in my head about how to to get there.</p>
