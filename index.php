		<h2><em> About Me </em></h2>
		<p> My name is Rachel. I grew up in Beaver Lake, Nebraska, which is roughly 30 miles south of Omaha. I graduated high school in 2013. After high school I attended 3 different colleges working towards a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. </p>
		<p> During my junior year at UNO I found that I really like coding, so off to Omaha Code School I went. </p>
		<p> I really enjoy mountain biking when it isn't too hot or cold outside. During the winter I tend to do alot of bowling with my friends. Another interest of mine is motorcyles. I grew up riding on the back of my dad's Harley. Now I ride on the back of my boyfriend's.</p>
