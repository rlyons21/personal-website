		<p> I read this  <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/teen-hacks-pentagon-websites-gets-thanked-for-finding-bugs/ar-AAhgHRX">article</a> off of Hacker News.</p>

		<h4><em> What I Found Interesting & Questions Rainsed</em></h4>

		<p><q>Hack the Pentagon</q> is a pilot project that the U.S. Department of Defense used to test for vulnerability in public Defense Department websites. It invited individuals to try hacking U.S. Department of Defense websites and report any vulnerabilities or security issues without getting in trouble.</p>

		<p> David Dworkin is an 18 year-old who just finished his senior year of high school. Dworkin spent his passing periods between classes trying to hack government websites. He found and reported six vulnerabilities. More than 1,400 other people participated and found 138 valid reports of vulnerabilities. Some of the issues found would have let others put whatever content they wanted on the websites or steal account information.</p>

		<p> The Pentagon awarded roughly $75,000 total to successful hackers. Awards ranged anywhere from $100 to $15,000. <q>Hack the Pentagon</q> cost approximately $150,000, which is significantly less than hiring a firm to run security and vulnerability assessments (costs more than $1 million).</p>

		<p> 138 valid reports of vulnerability on U.S. Department of Defense websites sounds like a lot of security problems for government websites. I imagine that the Department of Defense has many highly-skilled individuals developing and maintaining its sites. So how does that many major problems get past so many intelligent eyes?</p>

		<p> Being able to edit content and steal account information are obvious security problems, but what other types of issues would raise concern and make a website be considered vulnerable? Is there any way to test vulnerability of a website before it is made public? </p>
